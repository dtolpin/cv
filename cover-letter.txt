Last year, I have finished my PhD studies at the Computer Science
Department of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. As much as I enjoyed
the academic environment, I have been following the development of
software industry and am desperately looking for opportunities to
contribute again to the cutting edge technologies.

I have been both a successful researcher with a number of publications
at leading conferences and in journals, and a software developer
with experience in coding as well as in team leading. I would appreciate
the opportunity to work in PayPal Israel and contribute to development
of cutting-edge information technologies of one of the most exciting
companies.
