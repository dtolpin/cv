Objective

   I do two things well:
     * write cool programs that work, from design to support;
     * conduct cutting-edge AI research, from idea to publication.

   I like when I can combine both. Hire me in Israel. Available anywhere
   in Israel with 2 month's notice.

Research Interests

   Artificial Intelligence, probabilistic reasoning, bayesian statistics,
   decision-making under uncertainty, problem-solving search.

Skills

     * Computer science research: reasoning under uncertainty,
       combinatorial search, machine learning, probabilistic programming:

   November, 2014 - current
          [https://bitbucket.org/dtolpin/anglican]Anglican is a open
          source, just-in-time-compiled probabilistic programming language
          embedded in Clojure. Anglican is higher-order, Turing-complete,
          and supports accurate inference in models that make use of
          complex control flow, including stochastic recursion. It also
          includes primitives from Bayesian nonparametric statistics.

          Implemented Anglican, as a language embedded in
          [http://clojure.org/]Clojure. Community-maintained
          [https://bitbucket.org/fwood/anglican-examples/]examples of
