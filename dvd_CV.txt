Objective

   I do two things well:
     * write cool programs that work, from design to support;
     * conduct cutting-edge AI research, from idea to publication.

   I like when I can combine both.

Skills

     * Applied research: reasoning under uncertainty, heuristic planning,
       machine learning, probabilistic programming:

          [https://bitbucket.org/dtolpin/anglican]Anglican is an open
          source, just-in-time-compiled probabilistic programming language
          embedded in Clojure. Anglican is higher-order, Turing-complete,
          and supports accurate inference in models that make use of
          complex control flow, including stochastic recursion. It also
          includes primitives from Bayesian nonparametric statistics.
